# DDOS-Attack-Detection-and-Analysis-System
In the current digital environment, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks seriously threaten network security and stability. With the help of ESP32, this project shows a DDoS Attack Detection and Analysis System that can simulate different traffic patterns, such as typical, low-rate, and high-rate DDoS scenarios. The Python application uses Isolation Forest to analyze traffic in real-time. The application distinguishes between normal traffic, low-rate DDoS, and high-rate DDoS attacks by classifying incoming traffic  using Isolation Forest.

The two main parts of the project are the Python scripts that simulates, reads the traffic data, interprets it, and produces statistical analysis, and the ESP32 code host web server to which attack is sent. To further visualize traffic behavior over time, graphical representations of the classification results are shown. This method contributes to a better knowledge of DDoS attack patterns and shows how well hardware and software can be combined in cybersecurity applications to provide stronger network defenses.

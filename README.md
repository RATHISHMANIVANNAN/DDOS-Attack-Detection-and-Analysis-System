# DDOS-Attack-Detection-and-Analysis-System
This project simulates normal, low-rate, and high-rate traffic and sends it to an ESP32-hosted web server. A Python application uses machine learning to classify and visualize traffic patterns in real time, enhancing DDoS detection and network defense through hardware-software integration.
